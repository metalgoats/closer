One entry per working session, newest first. The *why* matters more than the diff — the diff
already records the what.

## 2026-07-29 — Output quality round (TASK-085…088)

Context: on 2026-07-28 Gabriel said the interface had landed but the outputs had not — he still
does the real work in ChatGPT. This round is entirely output quality; the dashboard was not
touched. The one insight driving it: Closer runs the *same* prompt Gabriel uses in ChatGPT, so
the prompt is not the variable — what ChatGPT has is accumulated context. The job here is to make
the system **extract more from each transcript and carry it forward**, so it needs less history
to sound right.

Everything rides the existing guard: the debrief pass is the only stage that sees the transcript,
and `draftContext()` deliberately strips coaching critique *of Gabriel* before anything reaches a
client-facing draft. All four changes respect that — new material is extracted in the debrief
pass and carried forward through `draftContext`, never by handing the drafts the transcript.

- **Adaptive output selection (TASK-085).** Added `statedFollowUps` to the debrief schema —
  what Gabriel told the client on the call he would send or do next, in his words, with the
  specific items he named. The draft pass now builds exactly that. **The SMS is never
  suppressed**: even on an email-only call, all three tones still generate and the prompt insists
  on a warm, send-worthy SMS. Removing that friction is the point — Gabriel would text every
  client if it weren't more work than it's worth.
- **Recipient profile (TASK-086).** Added `recipientProfile` — how *the client* talks and best
  receives a message, from their own language, including the personal facts they volunteered (the
  "I had no idea they were a doctor" problem). The drafts are shaped to the recipient, not to
  Gabriel: "exactly what that person needs to hear."
- **GHL note rebuilt (TASK-087).** Restructured into six scannable, bulleted, plain-text sections
  (CLIENT / GOALS / OUTCOME / WHAT WAS SAID / SELLING POINTS / WATCH OUT FOR), capped ~6k chars,
  so any teammate can act on it cold. **Structure only** — the house wording spec lives in
  Gabriel's OpenAI `GAB sales` folder and is not exported yet, so the finer voice is left for a
  second pass rather than invented here.
- **Outputs collapsed to one at a time (TASK-088).** Text / Email / CRM Note now share a
  segmented control (the same pattern as the debrief pages) instead of three columns fighting for
  the screen. The app opens on whatever Gabriel said he'd send.

Verification (the honest split): the two release blockers are proven for real, deterministically,
with no API key — `tests/llm.test.mjs` asserts against the actual `generateOutputs` that (a) no
critique field ever crosses into a draft prompt, verified to fail if a leak is reintroduced, and
(b) the SMS is never suppressed on an email-only call. The collapse was rendered in a real browser
on seeded data and confirmed to show one pane at a time on the right default tab. **Not yet
verified: the wording/quality of a real draft or GHL note** — there was no API key in the session
and the seed transcripts are stubs, so a single live generation still needs a human read before
this round is called done on quality.

New: `tests/llm.test.mjs` (29 assertions), added to `npm test` and therefore to the CI deploy
gate. `EXPECTED_DEBRIEF_CHARS` re-baselined 14k→12k for the shorter GHL note.
